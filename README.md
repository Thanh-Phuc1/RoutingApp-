# <h1>The Job Routing App </h1>
We are going to build a small app that practices the react-router library. React router dom is a super powerful library that helps routing around the application. One of the core things here is authentication. So how does website authentication works in the front end?

“Single Page Apps (SPAs) are often tied to APIs, and these APIs, in the form of endpoints, help provide data that can be manipulated in the logic of these apps. Some of these data the APIs provide are sensitive, so before they can be accessed some form of authentication needs to be in place.”

For example, when you get to a website, you need to log in first to see the private information that only users can see but guess such as user’s information, the salary of the job recruitment news, etc.

Also, you’ll have a chance to practice useContext, the Material UI and React Hook Form that we learn from the previous lesson. Awesome! Let’s get started!
